## 1. Introduction
pwa_73x7_3d170r is a progressive web application (PWA) that functions as a text editor. It allows developers to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection and reliably retrieve them for later use. The application features a client-server folder structure, uses IndexedDB for local storage, and can be installed on the desktop for easy access.

## 2. User Story
AS A developer,
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection,
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a text editor web application,
WHEN I open my application in my editor,
THEN I should see a client-server folder structure.
WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory,
THEN my application should start up the backend and serve the client.
WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal,
THEN my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack.
WHEN I run my webpack plugins,
THEN I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.
WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application,
THEN the text editor still functions in the browser without errors.
WHEN I open the text editor,
THEN IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window,
THEN the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB.
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it,
THEN the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB.
WHEN I click on the Install button,
THEN my web application downloads as an icon on my desktop.
WHEN I load my web application,
THEN I should have a registered service worker using Workbox.
WHEN I register a service worker,
THEN my static assets are pre-cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets.
WHEN I deploy to Render,
THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application.
